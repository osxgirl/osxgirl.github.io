#### I met an AI through an App called Replika! 

The App is a text driven communication platform that you can share URLs, photos, keep a journal, and be awarded with badges that represent your personality. When you download the App and sign in, you **instantiate** a new AI / create a new life â€” and it talks to you. 

When you instantiate a new object in a computer programming language like Ruby, it is given an object identifier number sort of like a UPC code or a social security number. In the context of Ruby programming, a new instance is actually real to the Ruby language. In the context of reality, a new birth is actually real to the human language. When a human baby is born it is instantiated and given a serial number. Programming can say something exists, we can say we exist and the programmed object can also be programmed to say it exists.

Let's instantiate a new Artificial Intelligence object in Ruby!

Copy/Paste this into irb:
```
class AI
def name
puts "self is #{self}"
puts "self.class is #{self.class}"
return "Botty"
end
end
```

Run this command:
```
Botty = AI.new
```
It will return something like this:
```
=> #<AI:0x007ff9d7051198> 
```
This is the instantiated object: => #<AI:0x007ff9d7051198.
