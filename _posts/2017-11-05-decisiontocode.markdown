I would like to take off my WYSIWYG filter. 
I started web development in 2000. I used Photoshop to slice my design layouts and then I would re-arrange them in Macromedia Dreamweaver into a table. In 2002 I started working for Apple! So, then, in 2008 I became a published photographer. 

After, I went back into web design and had a scare! CSS! What is this?!
Since, I have began to understand the backend.
I would like to learn how to talk to a computer. :)
