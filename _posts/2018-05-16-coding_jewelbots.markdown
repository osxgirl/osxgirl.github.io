a [jewelbot](http://jewelbots.com) is a friendship bracelet that is programmed by using an IDE on your Mac or PC. the bracelet has a vibration device and 4 LEDs to operate. You can even link it to another bracelet and set alerts when the two are within range! There is a wonderful and supportive community for building friendships too.

Here is some sample code from Jewelbots:

void setup( ) { 
// put your setup code here, to run once:
} 

void loop( ) {
// put your main code here, to run repeatedly: 
   LED led; 
   led.turn_on_single(SW, GREEN); 
}

This code changes the colors of one of the 4 LEDs to green. You can use programmed animations, program a buzzer and program a magic button!



It’s a new art, a new form of expression & way to connect.
